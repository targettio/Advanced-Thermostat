The Developement branch aims to add features. This branch is largely un-tested, contains a lot of debug code and may just not work.

Features to be added:
General
* DCHP - get an IP from the DCHP server (prevents IP conficts)
* Add a page for direct control 
* Add a page that is used to foward information to a server (which collates serveral fan controllers)

Direct control page
* Allow the user to turn the turn the fans on via the web interface
* Allow the user to configure the system variables via the web interface (e.g. TargetFloorTemp and MinimumFanRuntime)
* Basic html formating (make it look a little pretty)
* Auto-refresh

Info page
* Allow the remote user to turn the fans on via the web interface
* Allow the remote user to configure the system variables via HTTP GETs or JSON.(e.g. TargetFloorTemp and MinimumFanRuntime)
